Final project for DePaul University's [CSC 578: Neural Networks & Deep Learning](http://reed.cs.depaul.edu/peterh/class/csc578/): a convolutional neural network built entirely from scratch, in TensorFlow, for the recognition of *kuzushiji*: handwritten Japanese prior to the Meiji era. 

More information [here](https://erikmcguire.github.io/Kuzushi_jiNN.html#Introduction). 

In short, it is intended as a self-directed learning exercise, not as a practical tool.
